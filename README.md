## Fancy LaTeX resume template for academics and computer type people.

This LaTeX resume template is based off of one created by [Nicolas Favre-Felix](https://github.com/nicolasff).

It has a reasonable layout with special features to allow you to denote your relative level of experience / skill when listing items like programming languages. It also has colored tags to denote talks and publications as articles, abstracts, invited talks, etc.

See the example resume PDF.

This is free for anyone to use without restriction.
